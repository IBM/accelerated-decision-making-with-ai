title: Job Deployment Service Setup
description: Quick start guide for getting developers acclimated with the Job Deployment Service of the Accelerated Decision Making with AI Project
---

<PageDescription>

This service is intended to enable deployment of a job within a Kubernetes cluster. The service is deployed into the cluster where the jobs will be deployed, so it is assumed that the appropriate credentials are available.

The service itself has two endpoints, one to check if a particular job is currently running, and the other to deploy a new job given a specified json payload defining the image to be used, and the environment variables which should be injected at runtime.

To setup the job deployment service, follow the following steps:
<AnchorLinks>
  <AnchorLink>Prepare the Container Image </AnchorLink> 
  <AnchorLink>Deploy the Kubernetes Cluster</AnchorLink> 
  
</AnchorLinks>
</PageDescription>

## Prepare the Container Image(assuming IBM Container Registry)

1. **Build the Docker image **
    ```bash
    docker build . -t us.icr.io</namespace/jobname:tag>
    ```

2. **Push the Docker image **
    ```bash
    docker push us.icr.io</namespace/jobname:tag>
    ```
    Alternatively you can use the `push_image.sh` to handle all transactions involved while pushing an image to the IBM Container registry. 

    You can run the script by either:

    i. **Providing all the environment variables inline, when running the script with the correct variables. ** e.g. in terminal run 
    ```bash
    sh ./push_image.sh <TARGET_IBM_CLOUD_URL> <TARGET_IBM_CLOUD_REGION <TARGET_IBM_CLOUD_GROUP> <IBM_CLOUD_APIKEY> <DOCKER_SERVER> <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAMESPACE> <IMAGE_NAME> <IMAGE_TAG>
    ```
   
    
    ii. **Creating a .env file to hold all the required environment variables. **
    ```env path=.env
    # Shared variables
    DOCKER_SERVER=______
    CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=______
    IMAGE_NAME=______
    IMAGE_TAG=______

    # Push image variables
    TARGET_IBM_CLOUD_URL=______
    TARGET_IBM_CLOUD_REGION=______
    TARGET_IBM_CLOUD_GROUP=______
    IBM_CLOUD_APIKEY=______

    # Configure yaml files variables
    NAME=______
    IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME=______
    JOB_NAMESPACE=______
    ```

    Copy the above and save it as .env in the JobDeploymentService directory and provide all the variables. Finally, run the script by simply running `sh ./push_image.sh`

If the  image already exists in the registry, opt to pull the image instead of pushing the Docker image.
To pull the Docker image, execute;
```bash
docker pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]
```

## Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
Start by generating and configuring the yaml files, by running the script `sh ./config_yaml_files.sh` if you already created the `.env` file above. 

Otherwise, either create the `.env` file and supply the variables or supply the required environment variables inline when running the script.

1. **Check for the clusters **
    ```bash
    kind get clusters
    ```
2. **If there are no clusters, create a new cluster with a name of your choice. ** i.e. admai
    ```bash 
    kind create cluster --name admai
    ```

3. **To allow minikube to access and pull the image in the IBM container registry, create an image pull secret, update it in the ** `.env` **file and update it in the ** `name` **tag of the ** `k8s.py` **file **
    ```sh
    kubectl create secret docker-registry <YOUR_SECRET_NAME> --docker-server=<YOUR_DOCKER_SERVER e.g. us.icr.io> --docker-username=iamapikey --docker-password=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_APIKEY> --docker-email=<YOUR_DOCKER_EMAIL>
  
4. **Navigate to the `JobDeploymentService` directory **
    ```bash
    cd JobDeploymentService
    
5. **Allow the system user to access cluster resources by running; **
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f ocprbac.yaml
    ```
6. **Create a deployment by executing; **
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f ocpdeploy.yaml
    ```
7. **Create a service by executing; **
    ```bash
    kubectl create -f mkbservice.yaml
    ```
8. **Check whether the pod is started by running; **
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods 
    ```
    If it is not started you can check more details using 
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <pod_name>.
    ```
    
    If the pod is started, run 
    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/<service_name> 7080:8080 
    ```
