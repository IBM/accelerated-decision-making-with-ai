The models used in accelerated decision making with AI tool are domain-based mechanistic models that are treated as grey box models. These domain models provide information that is relevant to decision makers.

Grey box models are are mixture of Black-box and White-box models. White-box models are considered to be mechanistic and attempt to describe the underlying physical mechanisms while Black-box models are models are entirely data-driven models and their structure is not guided by any underlying physical
mechanism.

Accelerated decision making with AI tool is model agnostic, the domain experts expose a set of parameters for callibration or intervention planning. While the internal mechanisms of the model used remain as black-boxes to the tool, the different algorithms used return deterministic orstochastic results using the exposed set of parameters. This is of note with regards to how uncertainty may be handled from the model

A single model can be wrapped in different environments by altering the input sample space or/and output/observation sample space.
