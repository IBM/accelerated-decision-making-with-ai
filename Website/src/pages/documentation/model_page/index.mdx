## Onboard locations at different admin levels

| Admin Levels | Description | 
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------| 
| `0`| Country | 
| `1`| Provinces/States/County  |  
| `2`| District/Constituencies | 

To onboard locations at different admin levels,

Click on the country of your choice on the regional map 

If the region is color coded, that means that data has been loaded to the location, therefore you can start a new experiment or choose to view the model results

If not, add the location, load data into the location then proceed to start a new experiment or view the model results.

The same can be done to onboard locations at different admin levels

Click on the province/constituency of your choice, add the location, add data to the location then proceed to either start a new experiment or view the model results
