## Submit a new Experiment
After the starting a model experiment, the parameters needed to submit a new experiment are auto populated. 

The user can then click `Submit` to add a new experiment.
## View past experiments 
A list of the previous experiments executed by the current user are displayed.
## View dupicate experiments 
As there is no coordination between these independent experimental environments prior to running the experiment, there is a possibility of having duplicate experiments.

The list of duplicate experiments are displayed on this page
