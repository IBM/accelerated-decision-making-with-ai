                Policy Making with AI is a decision support platform that harnesses the power of domain models using AI
                in a trusted environment, bringing together policy- and decision- makers, modelers, and AI practitioners
                to support complex decision-making.
              </p>

              <p i18n="summary paragraph two|summary paragraph two@@summaryParagraphTwo">
                Decision-makers must plan and implement interventions and strategies at varying timescales across
                different populations and geographies. This could be to control the spread of a pandemic like COVID-19,
                or to manage climate impact risks on global supply chains. Models are essential in the planning process
                but are often complex, uncertain, and can be difficult to consume, and also need to be trusted. The
                space of possible interventions that the models represent is vast, making the planning and
                decision-making process even more difficult.
              </p>

              <p i18n="summary paragraph three|summary paragraph three@@summaryParagraphThree">
                Policymaking with AI (PMAI) contains a core AI decisioning library using algorithms from the
                sub-disciplines of Planning, Reinforcement Learning and Optimization to enable uncertainty
                quantification, impact analysis, and exploration of the full space of possible options to inform
                decision making. Further, PMAI is built on top of Hyperledger fabric to support model and data
                governance and provide trust and transparency for understanding the provenance of data, models, and
                results generated by end-users
              </p>

              <p i18n="summary paragraph four|summary paragraph four@@summaryParagraphFour">
                PMAI provides decision-makers with easy navigation through complex intervention spaces in a timely
                manner is required to generate the most optimal and context-relevant intervention programs, including:
                1.) An interactive decision dashboard to fine-tune what is important for their context (including
                what-if analysis, and adding constraints).
                2.) The ability to combine, learn, and compare multiple models.
                3.) Calibration and uncertainty quantification which are essential to decision-making based on the
                real-world observational data, as misleading information could be catastrophic for high stakes
                decisions (e.g. healthcare).
              </p>

              <p i18n="summary paragraph five|summary paragraph five@@summaryParagraphFive">
                Specifically, there are three ways in which what if analysis is performed using PMAI:
                1.) What if analysis where a decision maker defines intervention packages of interest and the platform
                runs them and generates predictions.
                2.) What if analysis where a decision maker defines a desired outcome trajectory and the platform uses AI
                algorithms to find intervention packages that meet the desired outcome trajectory.
                3.) Algorithm controlled what-if analysis within the constraints set by a modeler with the goal of
                interrogating the intervention space to reach at candidate intervention packages that a decision maker
                can filter through depending on their needs.
                To perform each of the above what-if analyses, experiments â€“ a group of model simulation with common
                properties defined by the user - are performed where the user defines the required inputs for each of
                the methods as indicated above.
              </p>

              <p i18n="summary paragraph six|summary paragraph six@@summaryParagraphSix">
                Our algorithms are developed to learn in the presence of uncertainty and sample the huge intervention
                space while optimizing the user defined goal. In the real world there are many sources of uncertainty,
                accordingly, to generate recommendations which are robust the algorithms must be able to learn in the
                presence of uncertainty.

                With trust at its core, this decision support platform is designed to amplify the value from domain
                models and data, and it is a demonstration of the value which can be derived from AI and Hybrid Cloud
                technologies.
